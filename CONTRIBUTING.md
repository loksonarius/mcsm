# Contributing

Heya :wave: we're thrilled that you're considering helping out! Hopefully this
doc can orient you on doing just that!

## How you can contribute

Given the small backing and large breadth of this project, there's actually
quite a few things that can be a huge help when taken care of:

- documentation edits and additions in README's, Wiki Guides, and Go docs
- feature requests and (detailed :eyes:) bug reports in [our
  issues](https://github.com/loksonarius/mcsm/issues)
- pull requests addressing issues, POC'ing features, cleaning up code, adding
  tests, improving code coverage, etc

Contributions both large and small in scale are welcome so long as they help
improve or maintain the quality of the project!

## Making your first contribution

Regardless of the kind of contribution you'd like to make, we suggest reviewing
our [project guidelines](GUIDELINES.md) and a few [open
issues](https://github.com/loksonarius/mcsm/issues) to get your bearings of
things around here.

After that, feel free to jump to the heading below that best matches your
intent!

### Ask for some help with something

While most projects may have a community forum or chat server for questions like
these, as of right now, this project has none. As the project grows and the need
for asynchronous topical chat increasse, we'll re-evaluate the need if/when the
time comes.

For now, please submit your question as an issue on [our
board](https://github.com/loksonarius/mcsm/issues) using the `Question` issue
template. At the very least, this will allow common question patterns and needs
to be identified over time, so please don't hesitate to ask!

### Submit a feature request or bug report

This is one of the easier contributions to make and can be done straight from
[our issues board](https://github.com/loksonarius/mcsm/issues)!

Before submittin a new issue, please try searching through both [open _and_
closed Issues and Pull Requests](https://github.com/loksonarius/mcsm/issues?q=)
for mentions of your suggestion or error. If you don't find one that matches
your case, then please feel free to open an issue to make a suggestion using
either the `Feature request` template or the `Bug report` template.

### Edit or add documentation to the wiki or repo

Depending on what's being edited or added to, this can be easily accomplished
straight from the GitHub web UI or with a few extra steps with a local repo
copy.

| Type       | How to submit                                  |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Wiki pages | Make edit suggestions right from the wiki page |
| Go Docs    | Fork the repository and edit locally           |
| README's   | Fork the repository and edit locally           |

The pull request made for each of these should be labeled with the
`documentation` label so that it can be prioritized for reading and review.
